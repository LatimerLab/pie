Latimer Lab pie bake-off materials

Judging scores can be entered into the google sheet here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uug4lYwZ3aecvPhbIARX3scJbaQbg0SJ2DAiEoFTAsI/edit?usp=sharing

Then download the sheet as a CSV. Run the bake_off_scoring.R script to compute each pie's score after accounting for varying scoring intercepts by judge.

A judging sheet (Word format) is also in this repo.
